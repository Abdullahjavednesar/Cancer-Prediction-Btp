# Cancer-Prediction-Btp

Cancer Prediction BTP is a small project on analysis of *Lung Cancer* prediction from its features. Lung Cancer is common disease is coal mining sectors. When most people think of the health hazards of coal mining, they immediately think of black lung disease, resulting from inhaling coal dust, but black lung is not the only hazard associated with coal mining. Coal miners also face a heightened risk of silicosis, from exposure to crystalline dust in the air, and asbestosis and mesothelioma from inhaling asbestos dust in and around mines.


The long-term health effects of exposure to asbestos in the workplace include

* Asbestosis, a type of pneumoconiosis (like black lung disease) that is also called interstitial fibrosis. The asbestos fibers cause scarring that may continue to grow even after exposure to asbestos has ended
* Lung cancer is related to the degree of asbestosis present in the lungs. High rates of lung cancer have been noted in miners exposed directly to asbestos dust and in their families exposed indirectly
* Mesothelioma is a cancer caused specifically by exposure to asbestos dust
* Cancer of the gastrointestinal tract
* Cancer of the larynx
